                        <ul style="display:inline-block;">
                            <li><strong>1756 </strong>- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is born on January 17 in a flat located
                                at what is now Getreidegasse 9 in Salzburg, Austria.</li>
                            <li><strong>1762 - 1765 </strong>- The young Mozart was, as we know, an early starter when
                                it came to music. But he was especially young to be a concert pianist in 1762, and even
                                more remarkable to be a touring concert pianist throughout Europe. Find out what he got
                                up to, how his father masterminded the whole thing and what those early concerts did for
                                Mozart's reputation in the biography link below.</li>
                            <li><strong>1766 - 1769 </strong>- How young was Mozart when he composed his first opera?
                                What happened after his epic touring schedule finished? And were the people of Europe
                                right to suspect that the young composer had been passing off his father's work as his
                                own? Find out by clicking the biography link below.</li>
                            <li><strong>1770 - 1773 </strong>- Early opera successes soon gave way to some work in
                                Italy, and before he knew it Mozart was a hit in Milan, Naples, Bologna... find out why
                                the crowds chanted "Long live the Little Maestro!" in our biography below.</li>
                            <li><strong>1774 - 1778 </strong>- Mozart had spent so much time with his father over the
                                years that it's easy to forget the influence that his mother had on his life. It was
                                never felt more keenly than in 1778 when she suddenly died.</li>
                            <li><strong>1779 - 1783 </strong>- It was a time of happiness for Mozart as his personal
                                life went through his marriage and the arrival of his first child - but the happiness
                                was not to last long, and the darkness that characterised his later life began to rear
                                its ugly head.</li>
                            <li><strong>1791 </strong>- The last year of Mozart's life was, to say the least,
                                tumultuous. Find out exactly how it broke down - from who commissioned his last work to
                                who was with him at the very end - in our biography article below.</li>
